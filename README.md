# Data-Analysis-on-Mental-Health-of-students

This project analyzes a dataset related to **depression**, **suicidal thoughts**, and **sleep patterns**. It includes data preprocessing, statistical tests, and visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and standardizes columns for easier analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - **Chi-Squared Test**: Tests the association between `Financial_Stress` and `Suicidal Thoughts`.
  - **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Checks the normality of `CGPA`.
- **Visualization**:
  - **Boxplots** for outlier detection.
  - **Bar Chart** for categorizing and visualizing sleep duration.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Visualizations.
- **scipy**: Statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Chi-squared).
- **statsmodels**: Model fitting and statistical analysis.

## Key Insights
- Statistical tests reveal significant relationships between variables.
- Visualizations help detect outliers and provide a better understanding of sleep patterns.

## Future Work
- Explore more statistical tests and predictive models for depression and suicidal thoughts.
